While playing her favorite FPV online game World Fantasy Online, Yuna receives an embarrassing bear suit as a gift for playing so long. The administrator of the game turns out to be a God, who based the game on her world. She then transports Yuna into said world without a real warning with the bear suit, which she is powerless without as it grants her special powers. Despite her initial anger at being teleported without consent, and that there is no way back to her old world, Yuna quickly adapts and finds her new life more fulfilling than the empty one back on Earth as her actions cause her to rise in fame.
